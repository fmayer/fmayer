Hi; I'm Florian. I have an interest in compilers, systems programming, and
programming languages.

I work at [@google] on improving software security and stability.

To do that, among other things, I

* contribute to [@llvm]
* contribute to [@android]
* participate in the [@riscv] Memory Tagging TG
